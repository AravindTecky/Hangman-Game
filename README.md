🎮 Hangman: 2-Level Challenge Mode

This project is a command-line based **Hangman game**, where players guess letters to reveal hidden words from two categories — *Animals* and *Birds*. The game is implemented in Python with clear visuals for the hangman stages, level progression, and win/lose conditions.

Players must successfully complete **Level 1 (Animals)** before advancing to **Level 2 (Birds)**. Incorrect guesses progressively build the hangman figure, and players can restart the game if they lose.
